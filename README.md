### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Niamh âš¡, a passionate professional with a background in medical devices and a keen interest in data science. With 6 of experience in the medical device industry, I've had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects, from regulatory affairs to product development and quality management.

During my master's degree, I undertook a project where I created a scraper to gather safety incident reports related to medical devices. This project not only honed my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of the importance of data-driven decision-making in healthcare.

Recently, I've been exploring the exciting world of data science through a part-time Python course. Leveraging my experience in medical devices and my master's project, I'm eager to apply my newfound Python skills to analyze and derive insights from healthcare data. From predictive modeling to data visualization, I'm constantly expanding my knowledge and honing my skills to make a meaningful impact in the healthcare domain.

This GitHub repository serves as a platform to showcase my projects, ranging from data analysis and visualization to machine learning applications in healthcare. Feel free to explore my work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or discuss potential opportunities.

Let's connect and make a difference together! ðŸŒŸ
